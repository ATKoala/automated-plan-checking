##### Some basic explanation of settings syntax #######################
# The basic syntax is:
# field = value
#
# Only one setting is allowed per line.
#
# The terms are typically case-insensitive except when specifying files or 
# directories when on a system that has case-sensitive filenames).
#
# White space is stripped from the beginning and end of the line, as
# well as immediately before and after the '='. "default_input" also strips 
# whitespace areound the separator (*), all other whitespace is left intact.
# 
# Lines starting with hash (#) are comments and do not impact the settings
# 


#### default_input ####
# List the locations of dicoms to be processed
#
# Each input item can be the path of a dicom file or a folder (presumably containing dicoms).
#
# Each input item must be separated by a star (*).
#
# Each input item can also be paired with a number to indicate the file or all 
# dicoms in the folder is of a certain case, e.g. item1,case1 * item2,case2
#
# Here are some sample settings:
#
# default_input = data/Input
# default_input = data/Input * data/Input/more-input/YellowLvlIII_1c6FFF,1
# default_input = C:\Users\Jimothy\dicoms\
# default_input = C:\Users\Jimothy\dicoms\ * data/Inputs,7

default_input = data/Input,7  


#### default_output_folder ####
# Specify the location of the csv reports of processed dicoms
#
# Sample settings:
# default_output_folder = C:\Users\Jimothy\dicoms\reports

default_output_folder = reports


### truth_table_file 
# Sample settings:
# truth_table_file = data/truth_table_lvl2.csv
# truth_table_file = C:\Users\Jimothy\dicoms\truth_table.csv

truth_table_file = data/truth_table_lvl3.csv

### silent_run
# Whether the diagnostic output should be printed or not
# e.g the text describing what dicoms have been saved where, which truth table is being used, etc.
# To run the program silently, set silent_run = True 
silent_run = False
