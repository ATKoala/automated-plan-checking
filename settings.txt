##### Settings file ###############################################
# For descriptions of all settings, as well as some more in-depth information
# on setting them, consult the file: docs/Settings.pdf
# The file is also available online at:
# https://github.com/ATKoala/automated-plan-checking/blob/master/docs/Settings.pdf
#

##### Some basic explanation of option syntax #####################
# The basic syntax is:
# field = value
#
# Only one specification is allowed per line.
#
# The terms are typically case-insensitive, except when specifying files or 
# directories on a operating system that has case-sensitive filenames.
#
# White space is stripped at the beginning and end of each line, as
# well as immediately before and after the '='. For the default_input setting,
# whitespace around the separator (*) is also trimmed. All other whitespace is left intact.
#
# Lines starting with hash (#) are comments and are ignored by the program
#

##### Sample Settings ##############################################
# Some examples for each setting.
# You can use them as a base to write your own values for each setting
#
# default_input = data/samples
# default_input = data/samples,7
# default_input = data/samples/YellowLvlIII_7a.dcm,7 * data/samples/YellowLvlIII_7b.dcm * data/samples2
# default_input = C:\Users\Jimothy\dicoms\
# truth_table_file = data/truth_table_lvl2.csv
# truth_table_file = C:\Users\Jimothy\dicoms\truth_table.csv
# default_output_folder = C:\Users\Jimothy\dicoms\csvreports
# silent_run = true
# skip_dose_strucure = false
#
