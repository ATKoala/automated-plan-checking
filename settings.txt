##### Settings file ###############################################
# For descriptions of all settings, as well as some more in-depth information
# on setting them, consult the file
#    docs/Settings.pdf
# If you can't find it, the file is also available online at:

#

##### Some basic explanation of option syntax #####################
# The basic syntax is:
# field = value
#
# Only one specification is allowed per line.
#
# The terms are typically case-insensitive except when specifying files or 
# directories when on a system that has case-sensitive filenames.
#
# White space is stripped from the beginning and end of the line, as
# well as immediately before and after the '='. For the default_input setting,
# whitespace around the separator (*) is also trimmed. All other whitespace is left intact.
#
# Lines starting with hash (#) are comments and do not impact the settings
