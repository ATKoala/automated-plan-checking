""" strings Module - A collection of commonly used strings throughout the project

Purpose:
- Standard string format: e.g. <"10x12" vs "10 x 12"> 
    Although they both look reasonable, format must be consistent throughout the project for equality comparisons.
- Easier changes: If a string were to be changed, it can be done with one change in this file.

What kind of strings go in here:
- Strings that are used in equality comparisons
- Strings that are used more than 

Including:
    - Strings from truth table values
    - Error message strings
    - Other strings
